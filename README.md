# PowerPlant
The end goal is to have a device that harvests power from house-hold plants.
I will accomplish this by having an RPI3B host computer talking to an arduino mega with a lot of sensors.
The RPI will periodically ping the arduino for an update. It will then take that data and display it to a webpage.
